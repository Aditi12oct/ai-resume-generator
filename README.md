Just completed my latest AI project — AI Resume & Cover Letter Generator! 🎉

This web app uses Google’s Gemini API to automatically generate personalized, professional resumes and cover letters based on user inputs like job title, skills, experience, and career goals.

🛠️ Built With:
Python 🐍

Streamlit (for both frontend & backend)

Gemini API (Generative AI by Google)

Visual Studio Code (for development)

🔒 Currently runs on localhost and is not yet publicly deployed.

🔍 How It Works:
Just fill in your details — name, skills, experience, and job role — and the AI instantly generates a tailored resume and cover letter you can use right away!

A perfect solution for job seekers who want to save time and still make a great impression.

🙌 Special thanks to Gaurav Singh and IBM for their support and guidance throughout this project!
